#arithmetic operators
num1= 72
num2= 45
print(num1+num2)
print(num1-num2)
print(num1*num2)
print(num1/num2)
print(num1%num2)# % gives the remainder when you divide two numbers
# ie. check line 8
#comparison operators
x= 6
y=10
z=25.36
#they give a true or false answer
print(x==y) # use two equal signs to mean equal to
# one equal sign is used to assign a number
print(x>y)
print(x>=y)
print(x<=y)
print(x != y) #not equal to
#logical operator
#include 'and' and 'or'
print(x>y and x==6)
print(x>y or x==6)
#practice
print(x==z and y==z)
print(x<z and y<z)
print(x<=z or x>=z)
print(y != z and y>=z)
